# School District Analysis
## Overview
In the PyCitySchools Jupyter Notebook an analysis on all of the high schools in a given district was performed to compare testing scores using various metrics. It was determined that one of that the 9th grade students at one of the schools were academically dishonest. In the 'PyCitySchools_Challenge' Jupyter Notebook the falsified scores were replaced with 'NaN' in the dataset and the analysis was ran on the cleaned data. This ReadMe will discuss how removing those datapoints affected the results.
## Results

  - The district summary, which averages the grades of all the schools in the district, is not affected by the removal of the Thomas High School Ninth graders. There are less than 500 ninth graders at Thomas High School while the district has nearly 40,000 students. Removal of such a small amount of samples negligibly impacts the average.

  - Thomas High School is a charter school. As this is a larger grouping of schools than the spending group and the size group, the metrics were not changed at all with the removal of the Thomas High School ninth graders.

## Summary
By replacing Thomas High School's ninth graders' scores with 'NaN' several changes in the metrics occurred. In the school summary the average reading score increased by 0.1 grade points, the percent of students passing math decreased by 0.1, the percent of students passing reading decreased by 0.3 and the overall passing percentage decreased by 0.3. In the scores by school size table the percentage passing reading in the 1000-2000 population bin, the percentage passing reading decreased by 0.1. In the scores by spending table, the percentage passing reading and the overall passing percentage in the $630-$644 range both decreased by 0.1. Finally, in the socres by grade tables the 9th grade math and reading grades in the Thomas High School row were replaced with NaN as all the data for the school was removed. In conclusion the effects of removing the Thomas High School ninth grader's scores was nearly negligible.
