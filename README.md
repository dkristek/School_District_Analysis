# School District Analysis
## Overview
In the PyCitySchools Jupyter Notebook an analysis on all of the high schools in a given district was performed to compare testing scores using various metrics. It was determined that one of that the 9th grade students at one of the schools were academically dishonest. In the 'PyCitySchools_Challenge' Jupyter Notebook the falsified scores were replaced with 'NaN' in the dataset and the analysis was ran on the cleaned data. This ReadMe will discuss how removing those datapoints affected the results.
